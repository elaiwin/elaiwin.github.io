          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">

                  <p> For my mechanical engineering senior design project, my
                    group members and I developed an autonomous robot for making
                     deliveries in multi-story buildings.  Packages can be loaded
                     onto the robot on the ground floor, and the robot will call
                     the elevator, select the correct floor, exit the elevator on
                      that floor and unload the packge to a designated area.
                      We envision the robot being deployed in places such as
                      apartment complexes and office buildings.</p>
                  <p> Given very few constraints on the subjec of our project,
                    we came up with a list of possible issues that could be solved
                    with an electromechanical device or robot.  Some ideas
                    included a dinner table setting robot, a dehydrator/compactor
                    trash bin combo, and an anti-lock braking system for bicycles.
                    We decided on our delivery robot as it gives us the chance to
                    research and implement mechanical, electrical, and software
                    design.  We plan to use a combination of camera and ultrasonic
                    sensor for vision and sensing, a solenoid attached to a belt
                    system for button pressing, and a four-bar unloader, all mounted
                    on a holonomic mecanum wheel chassis </p>
                  <p> As our team lead, I broke up the project into specific
                    phases and tasks within those phases.  I created a timeline
                    for each task and assigned each to a team member.  I was in
                    charge of manufacturing our driving chassis, as well as writing
                    our vision software and programming motor control and the
                    robot's logic.</p>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
              <h3> Chassis and Mechanisms </h3>
              <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                  <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_base.jpg"></p>
                      </div>
              <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                  <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_bearing.jpg"></p>
                      </div>
              <p>We decided on using a holonomic drive chassis because it would
                allow simpler movements when positioning of the robot inside of the
                elevator.  The chassis is comprised of t-slot extrusion, an acryllic
                base plate and 3d printed bearing blocks as drive axle supports.
                We chose to use DC motors over stepper motors based off of speed
                and package weight requirements as well as cost constraints.</p>

              <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                  <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_package.png"></p>
                      </div>
              <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                  <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_sensors.png"></p>
                      </div>
              <p>The four-bar unloading mechanism was designed to minimize the required
                motor torque and power to unload by lowering one end of the platform
                as opposed to lifting the other like a dump truck.</p>
              <p>The pi camera and ultrasonic sensor are both mounted to to a
                vertical sled which can be moved by a belt pulley system.  We originally
                designed for a solenoid to mount on the sled to push the elevator buttons
                but found that we could simply use the rigid sled to push the button instead.</p>

              <h3> Software and Control </h3>
              <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_control_flow.png"></p>
            <p>At the high level, video feed is taken from the pi camera and
              processed in the raspberry pi.  Once distance between the robot
              and desired target are found, the pi calculates the robot set
              speed and direction using PID control.  This is sent to the
              Arduino which then calculates the individual wheel speeds and
              voltages to apply.</p>

            <p>An Arduino is used for low-level control of the DC drive motors.
              The four dc drive motors each have quadrature encoders which give
              1200 counts per output shaft rotation using X4 encoding.
              The encoder outputs are read within the main loop of the Arduino
              by checking for changes in pin state between loops.  The main loop
              runs fast enough to catch all encoder signal changes within the
              design speed of the wheels (below 100rpm).  The internal timer is
              used run a routine at 20hz which calculates and adjusts wheel
              voltages based on the current and set speeds.  This routine uses
              discrete PID control on each wheel with control parameters tuned
              manually. </p>

            <p>The Arduino runs a loop in real-time to ping for distance and
              accept serial input.  When serial input is received, it parses it
              for commands.  Commands include changing motor PID parameters,
              setting robot speed and direction, stopping the motors, and
              requesting distance.  An interrupt service routine takes care of
              calculating wheel speeds and readjusting PWM signals sent to the
              driver boards. </p>
            <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/uplift_vision.png"></p>
            <p>Several libraries were used to program the vision and motion in
              the raspberry pi including GPIO, OpenCV, and Tesseract.  GPIO was
              used to control the IO pins on the pi for the unloader mechanism.
              OpenCV was used for processing the pi camera video feed and
              Tesseract was used for number recognition.  The vision system is
              capable of tracking the elevator buttons and panels with a frame
              rate of about 20fps.  Button detection was calibrated to the
              elevators of our specific engineering building and used traditional
              techniques such as thresholding, hough transforms and optical flow
              tracking.  Given more time, we would have liked to implement, train
              and test a neural network to increase robustness and to allow the system
              to work with many different elevator interfaces. </p>
