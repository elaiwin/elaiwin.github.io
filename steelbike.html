          <p> I wanted a single bike that could ride fast enough in traffic but could also handle a little off-roading, so I designed and built a bike frame to use as commuter around town and an adventure bike.  I started by determining the desired geometry for a quick handling bike with reasonable stability and comfort.  I then searched online for appropriate tubes and parts.  I decided to use round double butted chromoly tubes for the main traingle and seatstays and oval tapered tubes for the chainstays.  A straight 44mm headtube would allow the most versatility in using either a straight or tapered fork.  I then used SolidWorks to model the frame and check for crank and tire clearance.  After that, I printed out guides for mitering each tube by hand.</p>
          <p> I had previously build a carbon fiber frame using a very inaccurate jig, so I decided to build a sturdier custom jig that could be adjusted for different geometries in case I decided to create another frame in the future.  I machined cones to align the seat tube, headtube, and bottom bracket on the jig.  A threaded rod was machined to hold the 7mm thick dropouts spaced 130mm apart.</p>

              <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/jig.jpg"></p>
          </div>

      </div>
      <p>After jigging up the tubes and checking alignment with a digital angle gauge, the tubes were welded together by Travis Widick at the UCLA Welding Shop.</p>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/welds.jpg"></p>
                  </div>
          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
              <p><img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./assets/images/steelcomplete.jpg"></p>
                  </div>


      </div>
      <p>After welding, I coated the inside with framesaver to prevent rust and
        preped the outside for paint.  I used enamel spray paints for the base
        and sharpies for the detail.  The paintjob started to wrinkle in certain
        spots where I oversprayed and a few other spots were chipped during transport
        but the paint has been otherwise very durable. So far I have ridden the
        frame several hundred miles through traffic, up fire roads, and down rocky
        single track. If I were to build another frame or change anything about this one,
        I would probably lower and shorten the seat tube junction to allow room for a dropper seat post
        and upgrade to a larger range and lower gearing cassette to make climbing easier.</p>
